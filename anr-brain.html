                    <b>Summary:</b>

Artificial intelligence (AI) with recent progress in statistical machine learning (ML) is currently aiming to revolutionise how experimental science is conducted. In physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience or medicine, data is now the driver of new theoretical insights and new scientific hypotheses. Supervised learning and predictive models are now used to assess if something is “predictable”: Can I predict what people “think” from neural signals? Can I predict from DNA if a patient will suffer from cancer? ML is now used as a replacement for classical statistical hypothesis testing. In healthcare, one talks about precision medicine, virtual patients with the vision that artificial intelligence will allow to have individualised predictions from genomic, physiological or imaging data.
After pioneering breakthroughs in computer vision, speech processing or natural language processing, ML has now to face new challenges in order to impact various scientific disciplines and in particular health related applications. When considering medical applications, statistical and computational problems emerge. i) The first problem is related to the absence or limited amount supervision for algorithms: supervised predictive models need so-called annotations or labels to be trained and tested, and unfortunately too few medical applications can provide enough of these. ii) The second problem is related to what can be phrased as dataset variability, or in more statistical terms, distribution or covariate shifts. What has been called in computer vision the “dataset bias” problem, implies that training on data from a certain hospital is likely to provide less powerful prediction when testing on data from a different hospital. iii) The third problem is related to the difficulty of bringing the state-of-the-art tools to an environment that is not dominated by computer scientists but biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, medical doctors. BrAIN aims to provide the next generation of ML models and algorithms for efficient statistical learning in the absence of strong labels and large sample sizes. BrAIN will leverage clear use-cases in clinical and cognitive neuroscience (anaesthesia, disorders of consciousness, sleep medicine) to address general ML challenges: 1) study of various self-supervised learning tasks to learn from long and noisy temporal data 2) learning to augment data and increase sample sizes 3) robust learning in the presence of distribution shifts 4) development of tractable algorithms easy to use by non-experts.

 abstract = {Background EEG is a common tool for monitoring anaesthetic depth but is rarely reused at large for biomedical research. This study sets out to explore repurposing of EEG during anaesthesia to learn biomarkers of brain ageing.Methods We focused on brain age estimation as an example. Using machine learning, we reanalysed 4-electrodes EEG of 323 patients under propofol and sevoflurane. We included spatio-spectral features from stable anaesthesia for EEG-based age prediction applying recently published reference methods. Anaesthesia was considered stable when 95\% of the total power was below a frequency between 8Hz and 13Hz.Results We considered moderate-risk patients (ASA \&lt;= 2) with propofol anaesthesia to explore predictive EEG signatures. Average alpha-band power (8-13Hz) was informative about age. Yet, state-of-the-art prediction performance was achieved by analysing the entire power spectrum from all electrodes (MAE = 8.2y, R2 = 0.65). Clinical exploration revealed that brain age was systematically linked with intra-operative burst suppression {\textendash} commonly associated with age-related postoperative cognitive issues. Surprisingly, the brain age was negatively correlated with burst suppression in high-risk patients (ASA = 3), pointing at unknown confounding effects. Secondary analyses revealed that brain-age EEG signatures were specific to propofol anaesthesia, reflected by limited prediction performance under sevoflurane and poor cross-drug generalisation.Conclusions EEG from general anaesthesia may enable state-of-the-art brain age prediction. Yet, differences between anaesthetic drugs can impact the effectiveness of repurposing EEG from anaesthesia. To unleash the dormant potential of repurposing EEG-monitoring for clinical and health research, collecting larger datasets with precisely documented drug dosage will be key enabling factors.Competing Interest StatementD.E. is a full-time employee of F.

 abstract = {Building machine learning models using EEG recorded outside of the laboratory setting requires methods robust to noisy data and randomly missing channels. This need is particularly great when working with sparse EEG montages (1–6 channels), often encountered in consumer-grade or mobile EEG devices. Neither classical machine learning models nor deep neural networks trained end-to-end on EEG are typically designed or tested for robustness to corruption, and especially to randomly missing channels. While some studies have proposed strategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not practical when sparse montages are used and computing power is limited (e.g., wearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial filtering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before the first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning to focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones. We tested DSF on public EEG data encompassing ∼4000 recordings with simulated channel corruption and on a private dataset of ∼100 at-home recordings of mobile EEG with natural corruption. Our proposed approach achieves the same performance as baseline models when no noise is applied, but outperforms baselines by as much as 29.4% accuracy when significant channel corruption is present. Moreover, DSF outputs are interpretable, making it possible to monitor the effective channel importance in real-time. This approach has the potential to enable the analysis of EEG in challenging settings where channel corruption hampers the reading of brain signals.},

 abstract = {Population-level modeling can define quantitative measures of individual aging by applying machine learning to large volumes of brain images. These measures of brain age, obtained from the general population, helped characterize disease severity in neurological populations, improving estimates of diagnosis or prognosis. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have the potential to further generalize this approach towards prevention and public health by enabling assessments of brain health at large scales in socioeconomically diverse environments. However, more research is needed to define methods that can handle the complexity and diversity of M/EEG signals across diverse real-world contexts. To catalyse this effort, here we propose reusable benchmarks of competing machine learning approaches for brain age modeling. We benchmarked popular classical machine learning pipelines and deep learning architectures previously used for pathology decoding or brain age estimation in 4 international M/EEG cohorts from diverse countries and cultural contexts, including recordings from more than 2500 participants. Our benchmarks were built on top of the M/EEG adaptations of the BIDS standard, providing tools that can be applied with minimal modification on any M/EEG dataset provided in the BIDS format. Our results suggest that, regardless of whether classical machine learning or deep learning was used, the highest performance was reached by pipelines and architectures involving spatially aware representations of the M/EEG signals, leading to R^2 scores between 0.60-0.71. Hand-crafted features paired with random forest regression provided robust benchmarks even in situations in which other approaches failed. Taken together, this set of benchmarks, accompanied by open-source software and high-level Python scripts, can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts at developing M/EEG-based measures of brain aging. The generality of the approach renders this benchmark reusable for other related objectives such as modeling specific cognitive variables or clinical endpoints.Highlights- We provide systematic reusable benchmarks for brain age from M/EEG signals- The benchmarks were carried out on M/EEG from four countries \&gt; 2500 recordings- We compared machine learning pipelines capable of handling the non-linear regression task of relating biomedical outcomes to M/EEG dynamics, based on classical machine learning and deep learning- Next to data-driven methods we benchmarked template-based source localization as a practical tool for generating features less affected by electromagnetic field spread- The benchmarks are built on top of the MNE ecosystem and the braindecode package and can be applied on any M/EEG dataset presented in the BIDS formatCompeting Interest StatementD.E. is a full-time employee of F.
