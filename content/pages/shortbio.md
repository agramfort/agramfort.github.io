I'm currently research director (DR, HDR) at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr) in the [Parietal Team](http://parietal.saclay.inria.fr/). My work is on statistical machine learning, signal and image processing, optimization, scientific computing and software engineering with primary applications in brain functional imaging (MEG, EEG, fMRI). Before joining Inria, I was an assistant professor for 5 years at [Telecom ParisTech](http://telecom-paristech.fr) in the [signal processing and machine learning department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/) and before I was at the [Martinos Center](http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/flashHome.php) for Biomedical Imaging at [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/) in Boston. I am also a co-director of the [Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). In 2015, I got an ERC Starting Grant for my project called [Signal and Learning Applied to Brain data (SLAB)](erc-slab.html).
