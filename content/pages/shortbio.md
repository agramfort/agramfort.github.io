I am currently senior research scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](http://www.meta.com) in Paris. Previously I was senior researcher (DR, HDR) at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr), leading the [MIND Team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/), known formerly as [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/). My work is on statistical machine learning, signal and image processing, optimization, scientific computing and software engineering with primary applications in neuroscience and biosignal processing. Before joining Inria, I was an assistant professor for 5 years at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr) in the [signal processing and machine learning department](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal) and before I was at the [Martinos Center](http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/flashHome.php) for Biomedical Imaging at [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/) in Boston. I was also a co-director of the [Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). In 2015, I got an ERC Starting Grant for my project called [Signal and Learning Applied to Brain data (SLAB)](erc-slab.html) and in 2019 a grant ANR Chaire on Artificial Intelligence called [BrAIN](anr-brain.html).
